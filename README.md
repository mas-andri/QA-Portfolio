## About Me

Hi, I'm **Margono Andri Hastiko**, and I'm on an exciting journey to begin my career as a Software Quality Assurance.
Although I don’t have professional work experience in SQA yet, I have been actively learning through online courses on platforms like Udemy, where I gained knowledge about testing concepts, methodologies, and tools. I also completed a Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp at Binar Academy, which gave me hands-on experience in web development and a strong understanding of the software development lifecycle.
Previously, I worked as a store crew and cleaning service staff. While those jobs were outside the tech field, they helped me develop valuable skills such as discipline, responsibility, problem-solving, teamwork and I believe are valuable in SQA work.
I am eager to keep learning, sharpen my skills, and contribute to building reliable, high-quality software as I begin this new career path in SQA.

## Skills & Tools

I learned the fundamentals of Software Quality Assurance through Udemy, including how to create test cases, write bug reports, and work with QA tools. At Binar Academy, I studied Full Stack Web Development and gained experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, and frameworks such as Node.js, Express.js, and React.js. These experiences gave me a strong foundation to start my journey in Software Quality Assurance.

## My Personal Projects

These projects reflect my learning journey, from writing test cases to exploring QA tools. Each project has helped me improve my problem-solving abilities and strengthen my technical knowledge

### Saucedemo - Testing Project

SauceDemo is a web-based e-commerce demo application created by Sauce Labs for practicing and testing software quality assurance, automation, and performance testing. The application simulates a simple online store where users can log in, browse products, add items to a cart, sort products, proceed through a checkout process, and log out.

### Book Store - API Testing Project

The Book Store application by Demoqa.com is a sample web application designed for practicing and learning API testing and automation. It provides a set of RESTful API endpoints that simulate typical e-commerce features for managing users and books. This makes the Book Store application an ideal platform for exploring various API testing techniques, including positive/negative testing and authentication handling.
